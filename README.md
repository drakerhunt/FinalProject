# FinalProjectcpp
Character wounds and strain tracker for the Star Wars tabletop rpg made by Fantasy Flight.

# Synopsis
This project is a character tracker for Game Masters in the Star Wars role playing game from Fantasy Flight. It is designed to allow the user to have three saved text files. The program saves the charactes they enter along with their wounds and strain. If the user wants they may overwrite their saves by selecting the new game and the save game they want to overwrite. It does not matter where the program is as long as the files it creates are with it.

# Motivation
I wanted to make this code because I have a friend who is constantly the GM for our game of Star Wars. This code was written to help him to keep track of all the player characters and their wounds and strain. I also GM occasionally, and thought that this could be useful. 

# Tests
Start the program, select New Game, and then add characters. Overall it should be intuitive.
